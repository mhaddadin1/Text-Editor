# 19 Progressive Web Applications (PWA): Text Editor

# Description

This is a Web App text editor. When a user opens my application in an editor, they see a client-server folder structure. When they run 'npm run start' from the root directory, then the app should start up the backend and serve the client. When the text editor app is run from the terminal, then the javascript files are bundled using webpack. When the webpack plugins have been run, then the user finds that they have generated an HTML file, service worker, and manifest file. When the text editor is opened an IndexedDB has created database storage. When content is entered, the content in the test editor has been saved with IndexedDB.
